## **Project 1: Azure Compute and Identity Management**

**Topics/technologies Covered**: VMs, RBAC, Azure AD, Policies, Encryption, Cost Management

#### **Summary**
This project involves deploying a virtual machine, securing it using RBAC, applying Azure Policies for resource governance, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring costs.

#### **Scenario**
RadioCity Ltd - a fictitious company - wants to deploy a virtual machine for their web application, secure it with role-based access control, enforce a policy for naming conventions, encrypt sensitive data, and monitor the cost of the deployed resources.

### Project Objective
1. Secure Access: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce the principle of least privilege.
2. Compliance: Applying Azure Policy to enforce organizational standards (e.g., allowed VM SKUs).
3. Data Protection: Encrypting the VM's disks to protect sensitive data.
4. Cost Control: Implementing budget alerts to prevent unexpected costs.

### Step-by-step implementation
+ Resource group creation
+ VM Deployment
+ Configuring RBAC
